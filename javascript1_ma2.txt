//MODULE ASSIGNMENT 2 - LEVEL 1

1. What is a function literal?

2. What is the constructor?

3. What does the return statement do?

4. What will be written to the console from this function:
		function myFunction(){
			  return console.log('inside my function');
			  console.log('My name is Andy');
		}
		myFunction();


5. Briefly describe scope in JavaScript.




1. A function literal is an expression used to define an unnamed function. For example: var doSomething = function() {
                          								   Some code…
                         								 };
You can also give it arguments in the parentheses, which can later be given values in another function where it the function literal can be reused.

2. The constructor creates an Object. This object can then be given multiple properties and values. 
After this Object is created, you can use it as a blueprint for creating new objects with a starting point in the original object. 
Then  you can give this new object its own values based on the properties given in the constructor, and also you can add additional properties and values 
to the new objects.

3. When the code is executed and it reaches a return statement in the code, the return statement value is returned and the function execution is stopped. 

4. The string: ‘inside my function’ will be returned because the program execution never gets to the next console.log.

5. In JavaScript there is global scope and local scope. Scope defines which variables variables you can access. 
If your variable is defined outside of a function it is a global variable. If you only can access a variable in specific parts of the code, it is a local variable.
